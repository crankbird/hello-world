# hello-world
The hello world repository from the github instructions - may use this as a blog too

I spent a little time yesterday going through the [tutorial for markdown](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/) and decided that I'd used github as my blogging platform. I'd seen another blog where someone had used another utility to turn github hosted markdown to create blogs which looked pretty good and it seems that [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) seems like it's already reached critical mass as the documentation standard for pretty much everything.

## the evolution of thought
I also like the idea of having a way of tracking the evolution of thought, allowing various versions of a blog post to be immutable. Overall immutability of previous changes along with the idea of some form of garbage collection appeals to me on a fairly deep level.


## Some modificaitons

So, the tutorial kind of confused me, not sure why it's called a pull request, I would have thought it was a push request because you're asking for your contribution to be pushed into the main line of code. I've created another branch to see what would happen when you make multiple changes with commits in between each change .. hmm it seems that every change is a commit, I wonder if there is any automagic versioning of the commits, or you can tag them in some way

### Some information about pull requests 

So theres a hyperlink just next to the commit button which says "Learn more about pull requests" .. which takes you to <https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/> apparently its a request for others to pull the changes into the main code line that you've already pushed into a branch 

>Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a repository on GitHub

It also says that 

>we recommend that you use a topic branch for your pull request

Which makes me wonder what the heck a topic branch is meant to be
