# Some thoughts from my investigation into REST Authentication

Translate CRUD to HTTP

C = Create = Post
R = Read = Get
U = Update = Put
D = Delete = Delete

Interestingly most wesbsites I've been looking at put them in a different order Get, Post, Put, Delete

In a truly high scale environment how do you manage role based access control ?
